Writeup for Homework 1: Lorenz Attractor
2022-06-05


This assignment took me about 12 hours to complete.


Other random notes:

At one point I had intended to print the Greek letters s σ, β, and ρ instead of s, b, and r, but after looking into this, I
	realized it would be difficult to ensure proper display on other machines, so I dropped this pursuit.

After spending some time learning about the Lorenz attractor, I liked the appearance of this torus knot version, so I used
	its s/b/r values as my starting values. I added the s/b/r value display because I liked some of the other versions that
	popped up as I played around with the controls, so I wanted to be able to save them. Here are a few I liked:
	
	s = 19.0	b = 12.0	r = 87.0
	s = 2.0		b = 1.0		r = 102.0
	s = 10.0	b = 3.0		r = 15.0
